#summary Arduino RC Receiver Shield

= Introduction =

This page contains information to create an Arduino shield connecting the Arduino with the RC receiver.
There are two editions of this shield: one with the battery connector coming first, the other with the battery connector coming last.
The design places all routes on the bottom of the PCB, (there are no VIAs used,) however double sided print is still needed to solder the Arduino headers. Through-hole metallisation is recommended for the drills of the Arduino headers, but if you're unable to do that, you can let those headers rise a bit and solder them on both sides (, which happened to me).
