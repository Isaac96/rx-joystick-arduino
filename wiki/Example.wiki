You can see the video [http://youtu.be/xTvmYfnkBe4 here].
There is some info in the description.

In this scenario we use 2 cables to connect channel 1 and channel 2 of the RC receiver with Arduino's signal pins D2 and D3, and +5V and ground.
We don't use the [RCReceiverShield RC Receiver Shield], just loose wires (which is actually not recommended, but it was an early test).
