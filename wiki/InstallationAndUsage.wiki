= Setup =

This has to be done only once.

== Hardware ==

=== Required components ===

  * Arduino, with an USB cable
  Almost all Arduinos are valid, except if the [RCReceiverShield RC Receiver Shield] is used, some small-scale editions won't fit, such as the Mini, Micro or Nano.

  * RC receiver, with the corresponding transmitter and some extension RC connector cables
  With some newer receiver models, it may not work using the Channel output ports, and may only work using a PPM signal port, if provided.
  If you don't have any extension RC connector cables, you can make one by cutting and stripping the cable of an old/broken servo.

  * Optional but recommended: [RCReceiverShield Arduino RC Receiver Shield wiki]
  If not used, you can manually connect the receiver with the Arduino, as done in the [Example Example wiki].

=== Connections ===

  * Optional, only if you use the RC Receiver Shield: push this shield on the Arduino.
  * Connect the RC receiver with the Arduino (or with the RC Receiver Shield if you have one) using extension RC connector cables.
 ` `*Warning*: if you are using the RC Receiver Shield, it is important that you choose to use either the "Ch#" input ports *OR* the "BAT" input port (PPM signal), and correspondingly you have to put the switch to either "CHs/PWM" or "BAT/PPM".

  * Make sure all your connections are well-done, so that there can't be any short-circuit.
  * Connect the Arduino with your computer using the USB cable.
