This has to be done only once.

== Hardware ==

=== Required components ===

  # Arduino, with an USB cable
Almost all Arduinos are valid, except some small-scale editions, such as the Mini, Micro or Nano, if my RC Receiver Shield is used.
  # RC receiver, with the corresponding transmitter and some extension rc connector cables
With some newer receiver models, it may not work using the Channel output ports, and may only work using a PPM signal port, if provided.
  # Optional but recommended: Arduino RC Receiver Shield (see "RCReceiverShield" wiki)
If not used, you can manually connect the receiver with the Arduino, as done in the "Example" wiki.
All files (created with Fritzing) needed to produce the PCB can be found in the "/Hardware/RCReceiverShield/" folder.
