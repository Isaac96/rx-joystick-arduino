  * Implement PPM reading from BAT signal port on receiver or DSC port on transmitter (Arduino side)
This has not been done yet because my receivers don't output PPM on the BAT signal port (instead, it is connected to the ground), and I have no DSC cable.
  * Add command-line arguments (computer side)
  * Make the Arduino detection platform independent
Currently this works only on Linux, it may also work on MacOs, but that is not tested. 
  * Create a verbose dummy class for the virtual joystick if the python `uinput` module is not found
This can also serve as a starting point for the implementation on operating systems that do not use uinput (like MacOs or Windows).
  * Test with more receivers (currently tested with Graupner JR R700 and Futaba R142JE)
  * Add a joystick description file for some games, for example for Flightgear.
